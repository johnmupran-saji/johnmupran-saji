- 👋 Hi, I’m John, as of writing I'm a third year undergrad doing a 4 year integrated Maths Masters course (MMATH) with specific focuses towards, Statistics, Modelling, Mathematical Finance, Stochastic Processes, and Analysis (Measure Theory).
- My Passion for basketball and discussions around it has resulted in me being elected for President of my College basketball team and for my first machine learning project I want to make a predictor that can predict (with some variance) a player's stats for their next game
- using data from this season.
- 👀 I’m also interested in Quantitative Finance and FX so am planning on a project that is a simple bot that would buy when certain trends are going up and sell when certain trends are going down (again very simple bot just to get me familiarised about market dynamics and
- creating an algo bot so any and all help and advice I'd greatly appreciate)
- 🌱 I’m practically a beginner (other than R which is mostly used in all of my modules) so any and all help and advice from everyone and all I will be incredibly receptive and over the moon with :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source software for beginners, specifcally in the realms of finance or machine learning but again I understand I have a long way to go and am looking forward to the day where I can meaningfully contribute towards your wonderful projects!
- 📫 How to reach me: through email, github messaging if that's a thing hahah sorry I'm still new, and I guess that's the only two so far considering I don't want to put my socials on here just yet;)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Once wrote a 2000 word essay to another teammate of mine in an afternoon because I was so passionate to prove to him Lebron's better than Kobe when I should've been revising for my exams hahaha
